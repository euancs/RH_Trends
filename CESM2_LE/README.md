CESM2 LE RH data is downloaded using the Python script and formatted using the bash script. To avoid downloading too much data at once, it is better to download the data in parts (each ensemble is ~10GB)
Information about the CESM2 LE is found here: https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/community-projects/lens2
